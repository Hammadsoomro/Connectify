# SMS Receiving Issue - Final Fix

## Current Status:

✅ **Twilio Credentials**: Working  
✅ **Balance**: $6.48 USD  
✅ **Phone Numbers**: All active  
❌ **SMS Receiving**: Not working

## The Problem:

Your Twilio debug shows webhooks are set correctly, but SMS isn't being received. This is likely due to:

1. **Webhook URL not responding properly**
2. **Database connection issues in webhook handler**
3. **Authentication issues with webhook**

## Quick Tests:

### 1. Test Webhook Endpoint:

```
curl -X POST https://connectlify.netlify.app/api/twilio/webhook \
  -d "From=%2B1234567890&To=%2B15878573620&Body=Test&MessageSid=test123"
```

Should return "OK" if working.

### 2. Check Webhook in Twilio Console:

1. Go to https://console.twilio.com/
2. Phone Numbers → Active Numbers
3. Click on +15878573620 (or any number)
4. Verify "A message comes in" is set to:
   `https://connectlify.netlify.app/api/twilio/webhook`
5. HTTP method should be POST

### 3. Send Test SMS:

Send SMS **TO** one of your numbers:

- +15878573620
- +16138017161
- +19032705603

From your personal phone, text these numbers and check if messages appear in Conversations.

## If Still Not Working:

### Check Netlify Function Logs:

1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. Functions → View logs
3. Send a test SMS
4. Look for webhook errors

### Common Issues:

- **Database timeout** in webhook handler
- **Environment variables** not set in function context
- **Webhook validation** failing
- **Phone numbers** not properly linked to user account

## Immediate Fix:

The balance is now showing correctly. For SMS receiving, the most likely issue is that the webhook handler is timing out or failing silently.

## Next Steps:

1. Test the webhook endpoint manually
2. Check Netlify function logs when sending SMS
3. Verify phone numbers are linked to your user account in the database

The Twilio credentials are working perfectly, so this is a webhook/database connectivity issue.
